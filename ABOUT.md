# How ExcelAlchemy Comes to Be

Hello Everyone, I am a web backend developer, mainly use Python, SQLAlchemy, GraphQL, Pydantic in my daily work.

As a web backend developer, I have often found myself tasked with processing large datasets that were submitted via Excel.
However, the process of manually parsing the data from Excel files, identifying errors, and reconciling discrepancies was time-consuming and error-prone.

Often the work was duplicated somehow but not exactly the same, and the data was not always consistent.

After struggling with the same problem for multiple projects, I realized that a more streamlined solution was needed, as there is a saying `Don't Repeat Yourself`.

That's where ExcelAlchemy comes in.

ExcelAlchemy, provides a streamlined interface for interacting with Excel files.
With ExcelAlchemy, you can easily download Excel files, parse user inputs, and generate Pydantic classes without breaking a sweat.

One of ExcelAlchemy's key features is its ability to generate Excel templates from Pydantic classes.
This makes it easy for you to set up Excel spreadsheets with specific data types and layouts, and ensures that data is submitted in a standardized format.
Additionally, ExcelAlchemy supports adding default values for optional fields, making it easier to fill out Excel forms.

Another key feature of ExcelAlchemy is its ability to parse Pydantic classes from Excel files.
This minimizes the need for manual data entry and reduces the risk of errors.
ExcelAlchemy also provides a custom data converter, allowing developers to customize how parsed data is returned.

Finally, ExcelAlchemy can read data from parsed Excel files using Minio.
This functionality allows developers to store Excel files in a bucket and create data from them asynchronously.
This is particularly useful for managing large datasets, and ensures that data is stored in a secure and reliable manner.

Overall, ExcelAlchemy is a high-quality, well-documented Python library that is perfect for anyone who works with Excel spreadsheets.
Its ability to generate templates from Pydantic classes, parse Pydantic classes from Excel files,
and read data from parsed Excel files using Minio make it a valuable tool for anyone who needs to manage Excel data in their Python projects.
